# Auth0 Demo

Shows how to use Angular with Auth0.

## Getting started

```
npm install
ng serve --ssl -o
```

## SSL Cert Warning

The browser does not trust the certificate used by the CLI. Hence, you'll get a warning. You can bypass this warning or create an own certificate trusted by your machine for the CLI. Both is described in this [blog article](https://medium.com/@rubenvermeulen/running-angular-cli-over-https-with-a-trusted-certificate-4a0d5f92747a).
